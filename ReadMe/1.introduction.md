# Kotlin introduction


## How Java works
- TestClass.java is compiled by javac (Java compiler).
- Javac compiles Java source file into Java byte-code file as TestClass.class.
- Java byte-code file (TestClass.class) ends up in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- JVM understands byte-code and converts it into machine code, using JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
- The machine code is then fed to the memory and executed by computer’s central processing unit.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** — engine which provides runtime environment for execution of Java code.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** — type of compiler which does the compilation during the execution of a program (compiles the app when user opens it).
## How Kotlin works
- .kt file is compiled by Kotlin compiler
- It creates .class file which is nothing but the byte code which is intepreted by JVM
- That byte code executed by JVM
- For more details, here is the image below

- Does kotlin creates a class internally ?
- Yes, The kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime.
- Lets create a Hello.kt kotlin file and while executing it convert to Hellokt.class file to execute the class file by JVM
