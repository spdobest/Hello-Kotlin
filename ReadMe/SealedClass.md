# SEALED CLASS- Application have lots of states - fail, success, progress- It works in MVVM, MVI, MVP- Sealed classes are used for representing restricted class hierarchies, when a value can have one of the types from a limited set, but can not have any other type. They are, i a sense, an extension of enum classes : the set of values for an enum type is also restricted, but each enum constant exists only as single instance, whereas a subclass of a sealed class can have multiple instances which can contain state. - There are the properties    - Restricted hierarchies    - Set    - Types    - Contain Values- Basic example```sealed class Result {    class Success(val items: List<String>) : Result()    class Failure(val error: Throwable) : Result()}```  ```when(result){    is Result.Success -> showItems(result.items)    is Result.Failure -> result.error.printStackTrace()}```- In above when statement dont have any else clause because compiler knows that it only have 2 values- If you add another class inside Result then when clause will show error.```sealed class Result {    class Success(val items: List<String>) : Result()    class Failure(val error: Throwable) : Result()    class Cancelled(val msg: String) : Result()}```  ```when(result){    is Result.Success -> showItems(result.items)    is Result.Failure -> result.error.printStackTrace()    is Result.Cancelled -> println("Cancelled")}```
